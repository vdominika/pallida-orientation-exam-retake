Why would you declare your class as an abstract class?

Absrtact calsses are the classes which contains one or more abstract methods. 
An abstract method is a method, which may not be implemented, just it is declared.
By using abstract classes, we can inherit the implementation of other (non-abstract) methods, what we can't 
can't do that with interfaces - an interface cannot provide any method implementations.

For example if we are talking about animals, we can define methods, what all of them are
doing, ex. sleep and eat. Allof them are making noise as weel, but that noise is not the
same (the cats say "miau miau", while the dogs are barking etc.). If we are using abstract
classes, we can easily implement the common methods, like eating and sleeping and also are
able to differentiate between the different noises what they are making.
